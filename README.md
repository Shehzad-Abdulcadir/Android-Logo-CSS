# Android-Logo-CSS

In this project I recreated the Android mascot using HTML and CSS.

This project also includes CSS animations.

# Planning Stage

To begin I would need to create a very simple HTML document and link the CSS stylesheet to it.

There was no need to use any scaffolding tools such as Yeoman as this is not a large project.

I worked my way methodically, top to bottom. Refining the head first and then refining the body second.

As for Non-Destructive editing, I used the developer tools inside Google Chrome to test various different CSS attributes quickly to see how it will look before adjusting my main code. 

# HTML

Next I began creating the main structure for this project in the HTML. 

The structure consists of:

Main DIV - Class “Android”, this is used to centre and layout the logo neatly.

Two secondary DIVs - Class “head” and “body”. These DIVs house the head and body respectively of the mascot.

Further DIVs for the eyes, antennas and ligaments.

The DIV structure is important as the various ligament DIVs would be animated using the Hover attribute.

# CSS 

Ultimately the CSS is where the bulk of this project was spent on. This project uses many CSS attributes in order to get the look of the logo correct.

But firstly I adjusted the layout of the DIVs in order to centre them.

Secondly I created the main aspects of the mascot with shapes for the head and body.

# Head

The head area consists of the Head, Eyes, and Antennas.

The hover animation tilts the head as if the mascot is opening his mouth.

See the code for the various CSS attributes I used in order to achieve the look.

# Body

The Body consists of the Body, Hands and Legs.

The hover animation shakes the mascots hands.

# Animation

The logo is animated with the use of CSS Hover animations.

The head, along with both arms move once you hover your cursor over and then reset position once the mouse is moved.
